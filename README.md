# Calculator CLI App

Welcome to the Calculator CLI App project! In this project, you will implement a command-line calculator with basic and advanced mathematical functions. A basic, yet powerful calculator app built using Python. This project demonstrates the use of fundamental programming concepts such as functions, conditionals, and loops. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and more.

## Instructions

1. **Fork the Repository**:

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/calculator-cli-app.git
     ```

3. **Create a Branch**:

   - Create a branch with your name (e.g., `MbaliP`):
     ```bash
     git checkout -b YOUR_NAME
     ```

4. **Implement the Functions**:

   - Open `calculator_functions.py` and implement the functions as described in the docstrings.
   - Test your implementation using the provided unit tests.

5. **Run the Tests**:

   - Install `pytest` if you don't have it
     on Windows:
     ```bash
     pip install pytest
     ```

     ```bash
     python3 -m pytest
     ```

6. **Commit and Push Your Changes**:

   - Add your changes:
     ```bash
     git add calculator_functions.py
     ```
   - Commit your changes:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Implemented calculator functions"
     ```
   - Push your changes to your branch:
     ```bash
     git push origin YOUR_NAME
     ```

7. **Submit a Pull Request**:

   - Go to your forked repository on GitHub and click "New Pull Request".
   - Select your branch (`YOUR_NAME`) and submit the pull request to the main repository.

## Project Extension

In a few days, we will extend this project to create a mobile app using **Flet**. Stay tuned for updates!

## Running Tests

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
pytest tests/test_calculator_functions.py
```

## Make sure all tests pass before submitting your pull request.

#### Important Notes

```
- Only submissions from branches named after the student (e.g., john-doe) will be accepted.

- Ensure your code is well-documented and follows best practices.

- If you encounter any issues, feel free to ask for help!
```

##### Happy coding! ðŸš€
